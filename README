Allows Carrierwave to be bundled as a plugin with a Rails 2.3 app.

To use, just bundle this plugin along with Carrierwave in your Rails 2.3 app's vendor/plugins directory.

This plugin backports ActiveSupport::Concern, and stubs out Rails::Railtie, under the CarrierWave namespace.

Higher-level ORM features may not work, because of an ActiveModel dependency, which this plugin does not stub out.
